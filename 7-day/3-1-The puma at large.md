The puma at large

Pumas are large, cat-like animals, which are found in America.
When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma ~~**was**~~ ==had been== spotted forty-five miles south of  London, they were not taken seriously.
==However,== as the evidence began to accumulate, experts ~~**form**~~ ==from== the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions ==given== by ~~**prople**~~ ==people== who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

The hunt for the puma ~~**was**~~ began ~~**at**~~ ==in== a small ~~**vallige**~~ ==village== where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her.
It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts ~~**conformed**~~ ==confirmed== that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered.
The search was proved difficult, for the puma was often ~~**seen**~~ ==observed== at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening.
Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and ~~**some**~~ ==small== animals like rabbits.
Paw prints were ~~**observed at**~~ ==seen in== a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes.
Several people complained of "cat-like" noises ==at night== and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree.
~~**Now**~~ The experts were ==now== fully convinced that the animal was a pumaï¼Œ but where had it ~~**came**~~ ==come== from?
As no pumas ~~**have**~~ ==had== been reported missing from any ~~**Zoo**~~ ==zoo== ~~**of**~~ ==in== the country, ~~**it**~~ ==this one== must have been in the possession of a private collector, ~~**which was**~~ ==and somehow== managed to escape.
The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught.
It is disturbing to think that ~~**there was**~~ a ~~**dengerous**~~ ==dangerous== wild animal ==is== still at large in the quiet countryside.
